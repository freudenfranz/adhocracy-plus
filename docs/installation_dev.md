## Installation for development

### Requirements

 * nodejs (+ npm)
 * python 3.x (+ venv + pip)
 * libpq (only if postgres should be used)
 * sqlite3 [with JSON1 enabled](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension)
 * redis (in production, not needed for development)

### Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation

    git clone https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy-plus.git
    cd adhocracy-plus
    make install
    make fixtures

#### Start virtual environment

    source venv/bin/activate

#### Check if tests work

    make test

#### Start a local server

    make watch

#### Use postgresql database for testing

run the following command once:
```
make postgres-create
```
to start the test server with postgresql, run:
```
export DATABASE=postgresql
make postgres-start
make watch
```

Go to http://localhost:8004/ and login with admin@liqd.net | password

#### Use Celery for task queues

For a celery worker to pick up tasks you need to make sure that:
- the redis server is running
- the celery config parameter "always eager" is disabled (add `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False` to your `local.py`)

To start a celery worker node in the foreground, call:
```
make celery-worker-start
```

To inspect all registered tasks, list the running worker nodes, call:
```
make celery-worker-status
```

To send a dummy task to the queue and report the result, call:
```
make celery-worker-dummy-task
```

### Option 2: Docker Installation

You can also use Docker to set up your development environment:

    git clone https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy-plus.git
    cd adhocracy-plus
    docker build -t adhocracy-plus .
    docker run -p 8004:8004 adhocracy-plus

The application will be available at http://localhost:8004/. You can login with admin@liqd.net | password
